# DeMMO
A game engine created as an experiment in system architecture

This repository is currently under active development.  
It is likely to change not only in implementation, but in overall architecture as well.
A limited view of the intended architecture is visible in the file "UML.vsdx" in the root of the directory.
The file format of this UML will also be modified to accomodate those without the abbility to view Visio files.
